The class teaches you the application of Pranic Healing techniques for healing and alleviating emotional and mental imbalances.

							<p>Have you ever thought about your soul? Wondered where you came from? How you're born into your family?
Questions that all of us experience at one time or the other. The Achieving Oneness with the Higher Soul class aims to throw light on these ancient questions, giving us a rare understanding of the inner world of the soul.
Ancient meditations, kept secret for centuries, are revealed and taught to the public for the first time. These techniques allow you to accelerate the union of your incarnated soul (often described as the personality or lower self) with your Higher Soul (Higher Self.) This phenomenon is known as "Soul-Realisation", "Enlightenment" or “Self-Realisation.".</p>

							<p>Arhatic is derived from the word “Arhat” or Perfected Being.
Arhatic Yoga is one of the most advanced spiritual technologies that accelerate the spiritual evolution of the soul and one of the greatest gifts given to humanity.
Arhatic Yoga therefore brings out the greatness latent in every person by cleansing, activating, strengthening and transforming the chakras and the subtle bodies. Being a path to sainthood; Arhatic Yoga aims at transcending man to a superhuman with much increased intelligence, love and power. Its secret relies on its holistic approach to life and evolution, as a balanced development of all the chakras, virtues and faculties. Therefore Arhatic Yoga is known as a way of life, not merely doing meditations!</p>
